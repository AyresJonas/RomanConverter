# RomanConverter
This is my Zenvia code challenge implementation.
This is a simple application to convert roman numbers to decimal and vice-versa.
___
#### Tech
- Python

### Running the application
#### Requirements
> Python 3.6.3
>
> Careful with your python version.
>
> Always run `python --version` or `py --version`, they can have different versions.

##### Single run:
Open the application folder on a terminal and type:
```sh
$ python decimal_to_roman.py 10
```
or
```sh
$ python roman_to_decimal.py XV
```
Where "10" and "XV" are the parameters to be converted. The printed result should be (respectively):
```sh
$ X
```
and
```sh
$ 15
```
##### Running the tests:
On a terminal type:
```sh
$ python tests.py
```
The results will be printed shortly after.
You can also modify the _tests.py_ file to change the tests parameters and expected results.
